#
# Changelog:
#     Fri Jan 10 2014 - A significant bug in Honeypot generation accuracy was found on Fri Jan 10 15:02 CST, prior entries in this list should be discarded.
#     Fri Jan 24 2014 - Added cumulative honeypot hit count of an IP seen across all days.  This will take effect for existing IPs forward-going.
#     Tue Jan 28 2014 - Corrected issue with cumulative hit count incrementing properly if the IP previously had a cumulative value.
#     Tue Feb 18 2014 - Sigh, failed to correctly shard the Mongo collection the first time.  Dumped the collection and resharded, this list was purged on Feb 18 2014.
#     Tue Feb 27 2014 - This list is now 48 hours (172800 seconds) of rolling data.
#     Fri Jun 20 2014 - Oops, sorry about the lack of updates since Jun 16 2014, the collection expanded nearly ten fold in number of IPs due to additional feeds and I needed to update the query timeout values.
#     Sat Jun 21 2014 - Time for some necessary indexes -- db.findings.createIndex({ 'packetmail_honeypot' : 1 }, { 'background' : 1 }); db.findings.createIndex({ 'packetmail_honeypot.last_seen' : 1 }, { 'background' : 1 });
